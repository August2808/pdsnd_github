### Project Title
#**Explore US Bikeshare data**

### Description
In this project, I used *Python* codes to explore data related to bike
share systems for three major cities in the *United States* - namely;
* Chicago
* New York City and
* Washington.
The code is very interactive as it solicits inputs from the user, and
based on those inputs, imports city data and answers interesting questions
about the data by computing descriptive statistics.

### Files used
Three (**3**) *CSV* files containing data for each city were used alongside
the *bikeshare.py* file. They are:
1. chicago.csv
2. new_york_city.csv
3. washington.csv
